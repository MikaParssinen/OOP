# Object-Oriented Programming (DVA 222)
The course aims to provide basic knowledge in object-oriented programming and program development. Special emphasis is placed on practical programming in an object-oriented language, including programming of larger programs. Among other things, the course provides a good basis for further studies in object-oriented and component-based software development.
# Course content
- understand and be able to account for central object-oriented language mechanisms such as classes, objects, messages, inheritance and dynamic binding
- be able to explain how a larger program can be divided into suitable classes that work together
- practically develop programs by applying and utilizing the object-oriented class library and framework
- be able to independently program simpler event-driven window-based programs
- explain the advantages and disadvantages of the object-oriented paradigm in software development
